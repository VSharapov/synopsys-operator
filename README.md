## Perceptor-protoform: a cloud native administration utility for your scanning platform.

Protoform is a cloud native installation utility for blackduck's distributed system framework for scanning platforms over time
for perceptor (core), perceptor-convex, perceivers.

## Running

Make sure you have a kubectl client installed locally, which is configured and logged in.  

Then...

```
git clone https://github.com/blackducksoftware/perceptor-protoform.git
cd perceptor-protoform
./all-in-one-containerized-bootstrap.sh
```

... Thats it!
