# WIP : Not usable yet !!! We are moving components into this repository currently.

## Perceptor-protoform: a cloud native administration utility for your scanning platform.

Protoform is a cloud native installation utility for blackduck's distributed system framework for scanning platforms over time
for perceptor (core), perceptor-convex, perceivers.

## Running

### Note this is the first version of the installation component.  Overtime the amount of yml will be reduced to none, via interactive statements in the container itself!

Create a configuration yml, like so:
```
protoform-bootstrap.sh
```
